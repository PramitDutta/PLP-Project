All my test case will fail if run with the script. I have had to make some changes on the AST as in how it was printed and the types and tokens that were being sent. I now have a separate function to print the AST otherwise if needed. Due to lack of time, as i was working on fixing the bugs I could not make the necessary changes. 

My code prints the Transformed Tree and Output for some test cases. I can demo it to you live.

I tested my code by hardcoding the file names and checking one by one and I can demo it to you in that way if that is not a problem. All my test cases will fail because of mis match in the output of the AST.  I got all the test cases passed in the first part so you can consider that the AST I built was correct.  

I can now print the transformed tree and the output and show it to you.


My code fails for the cases when there is a tuple to be handled in a data structure and it throws a vector size overflow error. 


I would like to demo the project to you to show that it works.
